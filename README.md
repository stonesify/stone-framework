**Welcome to the Stone Framework**, an ambitious and comprehensive project designed to revolutionize the way web applications are developed, 
deployed, and maintained. The Stone Framework is an abstract framework that provides architecture, 
best practices, and specifications for creating omnipresent and cost-effective web applications, 
both backend and frontend. It is composed of three key concepts:

1. **Continuum Architecture**: The architecture to be used for creating omnipresent web applications.
2. **Omniplex Applications**: Defines the characteristics of an omnipresent web application.
3. **Stone Specifications**: Describes all the specifications needed to create omnipresent web applications.

Our mission is to provide a framework that is adaptable, cost-effective, and future-proof, allowing applications to: "**Create once, run everywhere**".

## Target Audience

- Enterprises
- Tech Startups
- Cloud Providers
- Software Architects
- Web Developers (Full-stack, Front-end, Back-end)
- Open Source Contributors
- Educational Institutions
- Project Managers
- Consultants
- DevOps Engineers
- Anyone involved in web application creation and deployment

## Vision and Mission

### Philosophy of Stone Framework

The Stone Framework is built on the principles of simplicity, flexibility, and collaboration. 
By standardizing the way web applications are developed across different languages and platforms, 
we aim to significantly reduce development costs, enhance interoperability, and foster innovation.

### Slogan

"**Create once, run everywhere**"

## Core Principles

### Abstraction and Specifications

The Stone Framework focuses on defining clear specifications and abstractions, rather than implementations, 
to ensure that applications can be developed once and run seamlessly across various environments.

### Flexibility and Scalability

Our framework supports the creation of web applications ranging from nano to macro applications, 
ensuring scalability and adaptability to any deployment scenario.

### Cost Reduction and Cloud Native

By leveraging cloud-native technologies, the Stone Framework aims to minimize application production costs and facilitate gradual migration to the cloud.

## Key Concepts

### Continuum Architecture

A layered architecture designed to enable the creation of omnipresent web applications that are flexible, adaptable, and scalable.

### Omniplex Applications

A versatile and modular application that integrates seamlessly with the Continuum Architecture, supporting a wide range of deployment scenarios.

### Stone Specifications

A set of guidelines and standards to unify the creation of Omniplex Applications across different languages, enabling developers to learn the specifications and apply them universally.

## Advantages and Challenges

### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** Create adaptive and scalable web applications.
- **Cost Reduction:** Optimize costs with cloud-native solutions.
- **Interoperability:** Simplify migration and integration across technologies.
- **Innovation:** Foster collaboration and innovation with open specifications.
- **Simplicity:** Streamline development with clear, uniform guidelines.

### Challenges

- **Initial Complexity:** Setting up the specifications can be complex and requires community adoption.
- **Community Dependency:** Success depends on strong community participation.
- **Rapid Evolution:** Continuous updates are necessary to keep up with the fast-paced software development landscape.

## Collaboration and Innovation

### Collaboration Space

The Stone Framework provides a collaborative environment where developers and enterprises 
can propose and validate new specifications for creating Omniplex Applications. 
Every idea undergoes a rigorous review process and is validated by the community through a Request for Comments (RFC) procedure.

### RFC and Community Validation

Each proposal is subject to phases of:
- discussion
- refinement
- and approval
ensuring that the best ideas are adopted as part of the global specification standard.

## Implementation Plan

### Steps and Timeline

- **Phase 1:** Define and document the core specifications.
- **Phase 2:** Develop proof of concepts (POCs) to validate the specifications.
- **Phase 3:** Build partnerships with key industry players.
- **Phase 4:** Launch and promote the Stone Framework within the developer community.
- **Phase 5:** Continuous improvement and updates based on community feedback.

### Strategic Partnerships

We aim to collaborate with cloud providers, FAAS providers, and open-source communities to enhance the adoption and implementation of the Stone Framework.

## Resources and Support

### Documentation and Training

Comprehensive documentation and training resources will be provided to help developers and enterprises adopt and implement the Stone Framework effectively.

### Community Support and Maintenance

An active community will support and maintain the specifications, ensuring they remain up-to-date and relevant.

## License

The Stone Framework is released under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE), ensuring that it remains open and accessible to everyone.
